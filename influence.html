          <p class="heading">IN INDIA</p>
          <p>Ganesha is worshipped on many religious and secular occasions, especially at the beginning of ventures such as buying a vehicle or starting a business.K.N Soumyaji says, "there can hardly be a [Hindu] home [in India] which does not house an idol of Ganapati. ... Ganapati, being the most popular deity in India, is worshipped by almost all castes and in all parts of the country". Devotees believe that if Ganesha is propitiated, he grants success, prosperity and protection against adversity. Ganesha is a non-sectarian deity. Hindus of all denominations invoke him at the beginning of prayers, important undertakings, and religious ceremonies.</p>
          <p class="heading">WORLDWIDE</p>
          <p>Commercial and cultural contacts extended India's influence in Western and Southeast Asia. Ganesha is one of a number of Hindu deities who consequently reached foreign lands.</p>
          <p>Ganesha was particularly worshipped by traders and merchants, who went out of India for commercial ventures.From approximately the 10th century onwards, new networks of exchange developed including the formation of trade guilds and a resurgence of money circulation. During this time, Ganesha became the principal deity associated with traders.The earliest inscription invoking Ganesha before any other deity is associated with the merchant community. Today, Ganesha can also be seen worshipped by those who practice Jainism and Buddhism as well.</p>
