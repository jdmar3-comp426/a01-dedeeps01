            <p class="heading">BIRTH</p>
            <p>There are many different origin stories for Ganesha. In some versions, he was born with his elephant head, while in others, he was given one. The most widely known version is one in which Ganesha was given an elephant head.</p>
            <p class="heading">POPULAR VERSION</p>
            <p>In this version, the goddess Parvati was at home on Mt.Kailash preparing for a bath. She created Ganesha by using earth which she moulded into the shape of a boy. As Shiva was away on his meditative wanderings, Parvati set her new son as guard while she bathed. </p>
            <p>Unexpectedly, Shiva returned home and, on finding the boy, and outraged at his impudence in claiming he was Parvati's son, Shiva called for his gang of demons, the bhutaganas, who fought ferociously with the boy. However, the youngster easily held his own against such fearsome adversaries and Vishnu was forced to intervene in the form of Maya and, whilst the boy was distracted by her beauty, the demons, or Shiva himself, lopped off his head.</p>
            <p>At the commotion, Parvati ran from her bath and remonstrated with Shiva for so summarily killing their son. Repentant, Shiva ordered a new head to be found for the boy and, as the first animal available was an elephant, so Ganesha gained a new elephant head and became the most distinctive of the Hindu gods. As a reward for his great courage in fighting the demons, Shiva made Ganesha the leader of the bhutaganas, hence his name.</p>
